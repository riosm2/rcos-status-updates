## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

This past weekend out project lead Alberto mainly spent his time focsuing on our strengths so we could choose who would work on what, Once that was decided I was put to be the front end lead. So now I'm learning bootstrap as of the past couple days. I've got the basics down.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

This week after that, the plan was to sort of figure out who on my team would work on what. More importantly, I'm waiting for the framework that Alberto will send me in place of everything so that I know what to work on next.


## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.

I had a lot of trouble finding out how to fork this folder but it turns out I just accidentally forked it to the wrong github profile so that was my own fault for not having realized this.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I'll have weekly updates every Tuesday now that I realized my own mistakes.
