## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

This past week I've finished the front page or at least the large base of it. So everything from small descriptions are done, including where you upload the files. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

Alberto has a couple frameworks he showed me that I will hopefully use soon however he did say that he wants to change them up. So I don't want to start using them right now as its possible it could be very different depending on how he decided to handle it over the weekend. So for now, I'm just cleaning up the website, and making it easy to add more pages.


## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.

Working with others is pretty hard at the moment because there is no repository for us to share our files just yet. Our team lead said he would take care of it as soon as he could.

## Notes
