## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

I've seperated tasks for me and my group partner to work on, simpler stuff like changing the colors and reorganzing the front page now that I ahve it done. I've aslo rehashed out the final design changes hopefully with our team leader Alberto.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

Upload the website I made to the git repository (We finally have a repository). Then add my website to Joe's backend code so it gets up and running, and fix any conflicts with Joe's help. After tha hopefulyl start fixing p the rest of the website and any links we might have.



## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.


Not anymore, I'm still new to front-end so things will now just move naturally slow
