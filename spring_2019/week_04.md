## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.


This last week I was working I had everything I needed to incorporate all the front end to the back end of the website. So I had now a repo I could work and collaborate with other's with.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

Fix all the errors I am getting from adding my website to Joe's backend code. It's my first time working front-end with a back-end to communicate with so there's a lot I'm unfamiliar with. 



## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I don't know what some of these errors I'm getting mean. So I have to figure that out. Now that everyone's here and not away for break I hope to talk to Joe and the team lead and figure these out, if not I plan to talk to a mentor.


## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

I committed code that doesn't necessarily build anything but its all I've been working on this semester (I've been a little slow because its my first time making a web page).
Also I was away on a conference for half of the week so I forgot to send this weekly update earlier, hopefully this still counts.
