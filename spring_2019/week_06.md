## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.
I've worked with the backend and the team lead to get another block (the sign in) going on my front page

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.
I'm going to do final touch on the front page as well as start the calendar page.


## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

I've just gotten sick so hopefully that blows over real soon.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
